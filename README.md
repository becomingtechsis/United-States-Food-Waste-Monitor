## Objective
This report tells the story of food waste in America. And to showcase my design and data modeling skills.

## Dataset
The Data is extracted from [ReFED’s Food Waste Monitor](https://insights-engine.refed.org/food-waste-monitor?view=overview&year=2019). It provides data on how much food is going uneaten in the United States, why it’s happening, and where it goes. The Data File is populated by 3 .csv files. Providing data on food production and surplus by state, year, and cause. It also includes data on proposed food waste solutions and their impact.

## Highlights
According to [Rubicon](https://www.rubicon.com/blog/food-waste-facts/),
- Food waste in America has skyrocketed in recent years, with 103 million tons (206 billion pounds) of food waste generated in 2018, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); the equivalent of over 450,000 Statue of Liberties.
- Each day in the United States approximately one pound of food per person is wasted. This equates to 103 million tons (206 billion pounds) of food waste generated in America in 2017, or between 30-40 percent of the food supply, according to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).
- How much food is wasted in the U.S. can be seen directly through its monetary losses. The annual food waste in America has an approximate value of $161 billion, while the average American family of four throws out $1,500 in wasted food per year.
- As it stands, the U.S. is the worldwide leader in food waste generation, with the majority of wasted food being sent to landfills. In fact, food waste is the number one material in American landfills, accounting for 24.1 percent of all municipal solid waste (MSW) according to the EPA.
- Food waste represents 8 percent of total global greenhouse gas emissions.

## Data Wrangling
Conducted simple data wrangling and data cleaning:

- Removed rows with missing values.
- Excluded null rows.
- Grouped the data columns by Facts and Dimensions tables.

## Data Modelling
Connected the dimension tables to the facts.

## Visualization
1.	I used a Colorblind Safe theme.
2.	Created  multiple tabs.
3. Custom Visual
•	To set the scene of the problem, I used PowerPoint to create the icons for the first page of my report and used a simple text box on the second page. The last 2 pages of the report display the food waste data.
3.	I inserted a Page navigator button.
•	 Customized the shape, colors, and font size.
•	Chose font sizes of 12pt and above for readability.
4.	Hid all tabs of my report except for the first tab. To ensure that end-users see only the navigation options provided.
