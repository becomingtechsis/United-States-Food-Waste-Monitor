# United-States-Food-Waste-Monitor

##Introduction
According to Google, food waste in the United States is estimated at between 30-40 percent of the food supply. 
This challenge is all about design, data modeling, and providing solutions in a creative way.

##Dataset
The Data is extracted from ReFED’s Food Waste Monitor[https://insights-engine.refed.org/food-waste-monitor?view=overview&year=2019], which provides data on how much food is going uneaten in the United States, why it’s happening, and where it goes. The Data File is populated by 3 .csv files, and provides data on food production and surplus by state, year, and cause. It also includes data on proposed food waste solutions and their impact.

##Data Model

##Data analysis/visualization
1.	I used a Colorblind Safe theme.
2.	Created a report with multiple tabs.
•	To set the scene of the problem, I used PowerPoint to create the icons for the first page of my report and used a simple text box on the second page. The last 2 pages of the report display the food waste data.
3.	I inserted a Page navigator button.
•	 Customized the shape, colors, and font size.
•	Chose font sizes of 12pt and above for readability.
4.	Hid all tabs of my report except for the first tab. This will ensure that end-users see only the navigation options you provide.
